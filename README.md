Some things useful to follow when write or start writint css (or scss).

### Syntax
- Use two (2) spaces indent
- Use one (1) space before `{` when declaring rules
- Selectors listed, each one in a new line
- Use one (1) space after `:` when declaring a property
- Write each rule per line
- Closing `}` better in a new line
- One line between related declarations
- Two (or more, see "Comments/Headings") lines between unrelated declarations 

```
.selector,
.another-selector {
  property: value;
  another-property: value;
}
```
